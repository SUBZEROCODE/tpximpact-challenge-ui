# For the angular project we are using Angular 20, previously I was using Angular 10 for my projects - so a lot has changed naturally.

- HttpClient import for interacting with the API via requests.
=> Now this is added via providers with provideHttpClient(withInterceptorsFromDi())
Interestingly I read into why, this refactor is because the HttpClient module itself only actually had that one provider in previously.
=> HttpClientTestingModule is now a provider of provideHttpClientTesting also.

-302 redirect and how Angular 20 handles it.
=> I haven't used this before but its cool how Angular knows that a redirect has come through and wants to handle it.
It presented a fun challenge when I was just trying to print something to screen but kept getting HttpErrorResponse from the backend API!
Initially I thought that I'd need to handle this myself with nginx or a load balancer to redirect to that route internally.

- Interesting how `ng update @angular/cli@20 @angular/core@20` now upgrades angular, haven't used before.
=> Moved package.json/package-lock.json to version of ^20.3.7

- Karma-Jasmine plugin no longer explictly prints the DOM as a UI, they expect you to run 'ng serve' to view UI.
=> Caught me offguard as I was expecting to see some output but alas this has been removed in later versions of Angular.
You can use injection into a custom DOM container and then view that but it seems over the top, instead can just log the HTML itself and check elements.

- Eslint configuration was tricky and required a lot of tries and imports of dependancies.
=> Previously eslint was bundled differently and this added some challenge to resolve.

- Github actions was failing due to eslint not being added.
=> Added in eslint and then fixed lints and then finally the build passed.

- Angular now supports automatic refactoring of its legacy components in places, quite cool but its changed from parameter injection.
=> Now using `ng generate @angular/core:inject` you can bring it up to date with using inject() function instead.
e.g. Instead of `constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}` its now just `inject(HttpClient)`
